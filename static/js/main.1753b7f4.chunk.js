With the large volume of training information out there, it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed and over-complicate things. If your primary goal is training for a powerlifting meet, don\u2019t try and combine 5/3/1, Westside for Skinny Bastards, a program to improve your 40 time, and a \u201cbigger guns in four weeks\u201d program from a bodybuilding magazine. It sounds ridiculous, but it\u2019s easy to find yourself trying to tailor your training to several very different goals. Know your goals, pick a proven program that suits them, and stick with it.","Never underestimate the importance of daily preparation in your training. In powerlifting, how you perform on the platform will be a direct result of how you spent every day of your training cycle leading up to the meet. This doesn\u2019t just include your time in the gym. This includes all aspects of recovery\u2014your sleep, nutrition, stress management, and mental focus. If you discipline yourself and devote your time to preparing for success, you will succeed on meet day.","Any proven program is based on strategy and getting the most out of your time in the gym. The conjugate method, 5/3/1, the Cube\u2014the list goes on. They are all developed on the basis of training optimally and efficiently to reach a goal. As a novice lifter, you may be able to go into the gym week after week and just go crazy for heavy singles, but before long, you'll need to be more calculated. You need to have a method to your madness in order to last long term in this sport. Just because you\u2019re in a sweaty heap on the floor or puking doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019re getting stronger.","In any good program, you'll be provided with some form of auto-regulation. This may be using a daily max, going for a subjective rep range, or changing your assistance work. You'll have days when you won't be at 100 percent and you must adapt accordingly. You aren\u2019t always going to be able to go crazy and hit a PR.","You can have the best program in the world, but if you don\u2019t work hard enough, you will fail. Along with the ability to pull back some days, every good program also gives you the necessary opportunity to push yourself to your limits. Whether it\u2019s your max-effort exercise in conjugate training or your \u201cthree or more\u201d set in 5/3/1, there will be times when you need to get in the zone and make a PR happen.","You don\u2019t want to fail lifts regularly throughout training, but if fear of a certain weight or lift starts to control you, it\u2019s time for that to change. If you can destroy a 490-pound deadlift, but 500 pounds barely moves off the floor, chances are you're letting that number get in your head and conquer you. Don\u2019t let fear control you in a negative way. If you\u2019re going for a tough attempt, don\u2019t pace around for fifteen minutes talking yourself out of lifting it. You\u2019ve been putting in the work. Now go execute and reap the rewards!","Don\u2019t approach the platform on meet day just hoping that you\u2019ll maybe, somehow be able to pull off a miracle and get your attempt. This seems common sense, but it\u2019s incredibly easy to defeat ourselves mentally before we even step on the platform. As we discussed earlier, prepare mentally and physically so that on meet day, it\u2019s just a matter of getting in the zone and making it happen.","Mental preparedness in approaching the platform isn\u2019t just a matter of confidence. Technique and the mental focus to execute it will make or break your performance. Countless lifters have discussed the importance of mental execution in training. Developing it starts right from the second you walk into the gym. Watch training videos of some of the top professional lifters. They train in such a way as to execute every rep exactly the same.","All the yelling and ammonia in the world won't get that deadlift bar off the ground if you don\u2019t believe you can do it. Training yourself to be confident can be one of the toughest things to do, but it\u2019s imperative for your success. Don\u2019t let fear or doubt ruin the months of hard work that you\u2019ve put in leading up to a meet. You\u2019ve sweat, bled, sacrificed, and devoted yourself to training for something many will never do. Be confident in that and, when your name is called, go up to the platform and make the decision to pull the trigger.","There are countless articles and resources that will greatly benefit your training, but nothing will ever replace years spent under the bar. The only way people like Dave Tate and the experts on this site were able to gain the knowledge that they share on a regular basis is through time spent overcoming adversity. They learned from both success and failure and devoted years to this sport. Read and research, but know that at the end of the day nothing can replace the lessons learned under a heavy barbell."]:["A strong system led by poor leaders will make a system poor.
